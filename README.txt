Escape Mines - PaweÅ‚ Hemperek - README

Description: it's one of the recruitment assignement I did. The task was to create a program that simulates turtle going through the maze. Inside the maze there were also some mines - if the turtle happen to step on field with mine, well... it was game over for him :-(.

Input was game settings (maze size, exit point, mines locations, starting point and facing direction of the turle).
maze size         -> 5 4
mines             -> 1,2 2,2
exit point        -> 2 4
starting point    -> 2 1 N
sequence of moves -> M M R M M R M M L M
sequence of moves -> R M
sequence of moves -> M M M
(this can be found in game.txt file)

In case of getting to exit point program should display Success, when turtle hits mine it should say MineHit and in case of not being stuck inside maze after making all the moves it should communicate StillInDanger. Possible moves are moving in the facing direction or rotating.

Below I included everything I thought the recruiters should know about when they reviewed my solution.

Assumptions
-----------
Since in the provided example there is 5x4 board with turtle starting on position (1,0) and exit point at (2,4) grid is as follows
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
| (0,0) | (0,1) | (0,2) | (...) | (0,n) |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
| (1,0) |       |       |       |       |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
| (2,0) |       |       |       |       |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
| (...) |       |       |       |       |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
| (m,0) |       |       |       |       |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
It was a little bit confusing since (0,0) should be in the down left corner, but I assumed that's "business requirement" to have starting point in the left top corner.

============

It's impossible for turtle to make move resulting him going outside of board. If the sequence of moves leads to such move it won't have any consequences (position or direction of turtle will not change)

============

I wanted to implement some settings validation inside my solution so I assumed that mine can't lay on the exit point, none of the points can be outside of declared board and in order to make settings valid there must be also any moves declared

============

With every new series of moves turtle begins from scratch (his original starting position).

General thoughts
----------------
I tried to create solution as simple as possible and reuse some basic concepts to model bigger ones. I could model the minefield creating two-dimensional array of size n x m, but that would result in lower testability and also wouldn't scale with increasing board size.

I'm certain that there are some parts of the code that could be more polished. I did not aim to write "ideal" code. Obviously I wanted to show you that I can solve this problem nicely, but also leave it in a state where it can somehow reflect code I would actually write on my day-to-day job. So it's a little bit "real world"-ish ;-)

I also tried to have test coverage as high as possible, but I didn't use any tools that would measure that for me. I wrote tests for methods I thought they should be tested and did not try to write tests just for the sake of covering absolutely every line.

I hope most of my design decisions are clear! I'm looking forward to discussing any doubts you might have during technical interview! :-)
